The album was released in the United States on September 10, 2013, by XO and Republic Records. Kiss Land was supported by six singles: \"Kiss Land\", \"Belong to the World\", \"Love in the Sky\", \"Live For\", \"Pretty\" and \"Wanderlust\". The album's sole guest appearance comes from frequent collaborator Drake. The album's production was primarily handled by Danny Boy Styles, The Weeknd himself, and Jason \"DaHeala\" Quenneville.\n\nOn March 17, 2013, The Weeknd announced his debut album would be titled Kiss Land. In July 2013, Amazon.com revealed that the album would be released on August 27, 2013. On July 22, 2013, it was announced that the album would be pushed back from August 27, 2013, until September 10, 2013. In July 2013, during an interview with Complex, The Weeknd described the album, saying:\n\n\"Kiss Land symbolizes the tour life, but it’s a world that I created in my head. Just like House of Balloons symbolizes Toronto and my experiences there, but it’s a world that I created. When I think about Kiss Land, I think about a terrifying place. It’s a place I’ve never been to before that I’m very unfamiliar with. A lot of it is inspired by filmmakers like John Carpenter, David Cronenberg, and Ridley Scott, because they know how to capture fear. That’s what Kiss Land is to me, an environment that’s just honest fear. I don’t know who I am right now and I’m doing all these outlandish things in these settings that I’m not familiar with. To me, it’s the most terrifying thing ever. So when you hear the screams in the record and you hear all these horror references and you feel scared, listen to the music because I want you to feel what I’m feeling. Kiss Land is like a horror movie.\"\n\nHe also explained the album's second single \"Belong to the World\", saying: \"Belong to the World\" is about falling in love with the wrong person. There are some songs where I talk about the same person, but I like to make every song about someone else. Thursday is a conceptual album. Whatever that situation was, I spent the whole album focusing on that situation.\" He also explained where the title Kiss Land came from, saying: \"I didn’t want to call it Dark World or something so generic. The title came from a conversation that I overheard and those words stuck out. Someone said, “Kiss Land” and I thought, “That’s going to be the title of my album.” It sounds so ridiculous. When I put  out everyone was like, “What the hell? This is going to be corny. It’s going to be all lovey-dovey.\" On July 21, 2013, the album cover was released. On September 1, 2013, the entire album was made available for streaming on NPR Music.","price":15.99,"discount":0.25,"rating":"4.8"},{"id":"563a9585-77de-481d-8f5c-fef02f8af61a","artist":"The Weeknd","name":"Beauty Behind the Madness","year":"2015","cover":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/qwpuxw1440604386.jpg","disc":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/yux77f1605555926.png","genre":"R&B","style":"Urban/R&B","description":"Beauty Behind the Madness is the second studio album by Canadian recording artist The Weeknd, releasing on August 28, 2015 by XO and Republic Records.

One promotional single has been released as well, the album's title track. It is The Weeknd's first studio album since 2016's Starboy, following the release of the 2018 EP My Dear Melancholy. The project is his first studio album to have no featured artists.\n\nBackground\nThe Weeknd first teased that he was working on a new album in November 2018, via a performance in which he told the crowd that \"Chapter VI was coming soon.\" On January 12, 2019, Tesfaye then proceeded to further tease the project and its sound by tweeting \"no more daytime music\" to fans, making media outlets believe that he was set to continue the darker music found in My Dear Melancholy. Following a trio of collaborative singles throughout 2019, on August 6, he further reassured fans that he was working on his fourth studio album. Then after a five month period of silence, on November 24 the single \"Blinding Lights\" was revealed through a Mercedes-Benz television commercial, with reports of \"Heartless\" surfacing a day later. The latter song then premiered on the seventh episode of The Weeknd's Memento Mori Beats 1 radio show on November 27, 2019. Which in the hours leading into the release of the radio show episode, The Weeknd announced on social media his return to music with the captions \"the fall starts tomorrow night\" and \"Tonight we start a new brain melting psychotic chapter! Let's go!\". Both singles were met with critical and commercial success, with \"Heartless\" becoming his fourth number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 and \"Blinding Lights\" reaching number one in various countries worldwide. On February 13, 2020, The Weeknd revealed the title of the project \"After Hours\" through a 48 second teaser. A couple days after the announcement of the album's name, its release date of March 20, 2020, was shared through social media to accompany the title track's release as a promotional single. In the last week leading up to the album's release, After Hours' tracklist was revealed on March 17, 2020. On March 19, 2020, The Weeknd announced that the album is dedicated to long time fan and host of the popular XO Podcast, Lance, who died the night before.

Narrated by Canadian-American actor Jim Carrey, the album features guest vocals from Tyler, the Creator and Lil Wayne, and spoken word appearances from Quincy Jones and Josh Safdie. As the album's executive producers, the Weeknd, Max Martin and Oneohtrix Point Never recruited a variety of other producers such as Oscar Holter, Calvin Harris and Swedish House Mafia.\n\nA follow-up to the Weeknd's fourth studio album After Hours (2020), Dawn FM has been described as an upbeat dance-pop record rooted in 1980's synth-pop and heavily drawing from the era's new wave, funk and electronic dance styles. The album was preceded by the lead single \"Take My Breath\", which peaked at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100. In support of both Dawn FM and After Hours, the Weeknd plans to embark on the After Hours til Dawn Stadium Tour, scheduled to visit Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, and the Americas in the summer of 2022.\n\nBackground\nOn March 20, 2020, the Weeknd released his fourth studio album After Hours, during the beginning of COVID-19 restrictions. Primarily produced by the singer-songwriter, the featureless album was a commercial success and was met with generally positive reviews, with some music critics naming it his best work yet. Shortly after its release, the Weeknd began working on a new album. During an interview with Rolling Stone in September 2020, he stated that he \"might have another album ready to go by the time this quarantine is over\".\n\nThe Weeknd began to tease a new album in May 2021 during an interview with Variety, in which he stated \"if the last record is the After Hours of the night, then The Dawn is coming\". He continued to tease the album with the tentative title The Dawn during his acceptance speeches at the 2021 Billboard Music Awards and the 2021 iHeartRadio Music Awards. On August 2, the Weeknd released an initial teaser on his social media pages titled \"The Dawn is Coming\", which contained a snippet of a then-unreleased song. Later that day, in a partnership with NBC Sports and the 2020 Summer Olympics, he announced the album's lead single \"Take My Breath\", which was released on August 6.\n\nOn October 4, 2021, during an episode of his Apple Music 1 radio show, Memento Mori, the Weeknd announced that the album was complete, and that he was waiting on a \"couple characters that are key to the narrative\". He then described the characters as \"some people that are near and dear to me, some people that inspired my life as a child and some that inspire me now.\"\n\nOn January 1, 2022, the Weeknd teased a possible surprise album release in an Instagram post, which featured a screenshot of a text conversation he had with best friend and creative director La Mar Taylor. While they exchanged New Year's greetings, the Weeknd replied that \"Everything feels chaotic again. Music can heal and that feels more important than another album rollout. Let's just drop the whole thing and enjoy it with the people... XO.\" The next day, the Weeknd teased the album's arrival, tweeting \"wake up at dawn tomorrow\". On January 3, he formally revealed the album's official title through an album trailer and announced that it would be released on January 7. He subsequently announced the track listing through a second trailer on January 5.\n\nConcept\nDawn FM incorporates a \"psychedelic radio\" aesthetic with existential themes, similar to American experimental record producer Oneohtrix Point Never's album Magic Oneohtrix Point Never (2020), which the Weeknd appeared on and executive produced under his formal name. In an interview with Billboard on November 23, 2021, the Weeknd elaborated on these themes, saying:\n\nPicture the album being like the listener is dead. And they're stuck in this purgatory state, which I always imagined would be like being stuck in traffic waiting to reach the light at the end of the tunnel. And while you're stuck in traffic, they got a radio station playing in the car, with a radio host guiding you to the light and helping you transition to the other side. So it could feel celebratory, could feel bleak, however, you want to make it feel, but that's what 'The Dawn' is for me.\n\nArtwork\nThe standard Dawn FM album cover shows a dramatically aged and bearded version of the Weeknd in a dark setting with a small ray of light shining over his shoulder, symbolizing the album's themes of life transitioning to death. The collector's editions of the album, listed on the Weeknd's online store, features three alternate Dawn FM covers designed by American artist Robert Beatty, who also designed the album cover for OPN's Magic Oneohtrix Point Never. The HMV and Target exclusive alternate covers were also designed by Beatty.","price":29.99,"discount":0.35,"rating":"3.2"},{"id":"0619a2da-2233-4b5b-ae93-ce5570744b0a","artist":"Sade","name":"Diamond Life","year":"1984","cover":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/d3v6jk1640629974.jpg","disc":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/mhgeh71640630033.png","genre":"Soul","style":"Urban/R&B","description":"Diamond Life is the debut album by the English group Sade.

File-sharing networks such as Napster were flooded with bogus files bearing the titles' names. At the time, Tool members were outspokenly critical of file-sharing networks in general due to their impact on artists that are dependent on record sales to continue their careers. Keenan said during an interview with NY Rock in 2000, \"I think there are a lot of other industries out there that might deserve being destroyed. The ones who get hurt by MP3s are not so much companies or the business, but the artists, people who are trying to write songs.\"\n\nA month later, the band revealed that the new album was actually titled Lateralus; the name Systema Encéphale and the tracklist had been a ruse. Lateralus and the corresponding tours would take Tool a step further toward art rock and progressive rock territory. Rolling Stone wrote in an attempt to summarize the album that \"Drums, bass and guitars move in jarring cycles of hyperhowl and near-silent death march ... The prolonged running times of most of Lateralus' thirteen tracks are misleading; the entire album rolls and stomps with suitelike purpose.\" Joshua Klein of The A.V. Club expressed his opinion that Lateralus, with its 79 minutes and relatively complex and long songs—topped by the ten-and-a-half-minute music video for \"Parabola\"—posed a challenge to fans and music programming alike.\n\nThe album became a worldwide success, reaching No.1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart in its debut week. Tool received their second Grammy Award for the best metal performance of 2001 for the song \"Schism\".

Allmusic saw the album's success in the \"striking, haunting visuals that complemented the album's nihilistic yet wistful mood.\" It was eventually certified double platinum by the RIAA on May 14, 2001.\n\nAs of July 7, 2010, Undertow has sold 2,910,000 copies in the US.\n\nThe album was recorded between October and December 1992 at Grand Master Studios, Hollywood, California, by Sylvia Massy. Some of the songs featured on the album are songs that the band decided to not release on their first EP, Opiate.\nThe album art was designed by Adam Jones.Photos in the liner notes of a nude obese woman, a nude man of normal weight, and the band members with pins in the sides of their heads generated controversy, resulting in the album being removed from stores such as Kmart and Wal-Mart.The band reacted by releasing another version, which depicted a giant bar code on a white background.\n\nThis version of the album included a note from the band.\n\nThe message on the photographs of the band members reads \"Trust me trust me trust me trust me trust me I just want to start this over say you won't go this is love I'll make weapons out of my imperfections lay back and let me show you another way only this one holy medium brings me peace of mind cleanse and purge me in the water twice as loud as reason euphoria I've been far too sympathetic no one told you to come I hope it sucks you down life feeds on life this is necessary.\" This passage contains lyrics from all of the songs of the album.\n\nIn some versions of the album, when the black CD tray is removed from the case, a picture of a cow licking what appears to be its genital region is revealed. In other versions of the album, released internationally, the picture of the cow licking the genital region is viewable without problems under the transparent backing of the disc case. The photo of the cow is accredited in the album's liner notes to have been taken by Danielle Bregman. The ribcage is also on the front cover of the album, but the obese woman is absent from the booklet of the musical album, only the members of the band are depicted.\n\nAdam Jones' pet pig, Moe, appears on the back cover\namid an array of forks standing on end.\n\nComedian Bill Hicks is noted as \"inspiration\" in the liner notes. His presence would feature again on Tool's next album.\n\nChris Haskett, then with the Rollins Band, is credited in the liner notes with \"sledge hammer\", probably relating to the \"three pianos and shotguns smashed with sledgehammers\" on \"Disgustipated\".\nAdam Jones recalls a story in which the band purchased two second-hand pianos with the intention of blasting them with shotguns in the indoor parking lot of Grand Master Studio and putting the resulting sounds to tape. Apparently the man running the studio was happy as long as they cleaned up the mess afterwards. Since the incident, Tool has been approached by other bands claiming to have seen the shotgun holes left by them in the carpark wall.","price":19.99,"discount":0.3,"rating":"4.1"},{"id":"b2a28f32-fc8b-4a7c-a2a6-f19c812fec5e","artist":"Tool","name":"10,000 Days","year":"2006","cover":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/10000-days-4e3c6d44336f3.jpg","disc":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/10000-days-4ee3ebec049da.png","genre":"Progressive Metal","style":"Metal","description":"Fifteen years into the band's career, Tool had acquired what Dan Epstein of Revolver described as a devoted \"cult\" following, and as details about the band's next album emerged, such as the influence of Lateralus tourmates Fantômas and Meshuggah, controversy surrounding the new Tool album surfaced with speculation over song titles and pre-release rumors of leaked songs. Speculation over possible album titles was dismissed with a news item on the official Tool website, announcing that the new album's name was 10,000 Days. Nevertheless, speculation continued, with allegations that 10,000 Days was merely a \"decoy\" album to fool audiences. The rumor was proven false when a leaked copy of the album was distributed via filesharing networks a week prior to its official release.\n\nThe album opener, \"Vicarious\", premiered on U.S. radio stations on April 17, 2006. The album premiered on May 2 in the U.S. and debuted at the top spots of various international charts. 10,000 Days sold 564,000 copies in its opening week in the U.S. and was number one on the Billboard 200 charts, doubling the sales of Pearl Jam's self-titled album, its closest competitor. However, 10,000 Days was received less favorably by critics than its predecessor Lateralus had been.\n\nAfter the release of 10,000 Days, a tour kicked off at Coachella on April 30. The touring schedule was similar to the Lateralus tour of 2001; supporting acts were Isis and Mastodon. During a short break early the next year, after touring Australia and New Zealand, drummer Carey suffered a biceps tear during a skirmish with his girlfriend's dog, casting uncertainty on the band's upcoming concerts in North America. Carey underwent surgery on February 21 and several performances had to be postponed. Back on tour by April, Tool appeared on June 15 as a headliner at the Bonnaroo Music Festival with a guest appearance from Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello on \"Lateralus\". Meanwhile, \"Vicarious\" was a nominee for Best Hard Rock Performance and 10,000 Days won Best Recording Package at the 49th Grammy Awards.

As of July 7, 2010, Ænima has sold 3,429,000 copies in the US.\nThe album appeared on several lists of the best albums of 1996, including that of Kerrang! and Terrorizer. The album won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1998. In 2003, Ænima was ranked the 6th most influential album of all time by Kerrang! In 2006, it placed 14th on a Guitar World readers poll that attempted to find the best 100 guitar albums.\n\nThe title Ænima is a combination of the words 'anima' (Latin for 'soul' associated with the ideas of \"life force\" and a term often used by psychologist Carl Jung) and 'enema', the medical procedure.\nMusic videos were made for \"Stinkfist\" and \"Ænema\". Promotional singles were issued for \"H.\" and \"Forty Six & 2\".

It is the band's first album in thirteen years, due to creative, personal, and legal issues band members encountered since 2006's 10,000 Days. The album was released on August 30, 2019, to critical acclaim, with reviewers agreeing that the band had successfully refined their established sound.\n\nBackground\nWriting\nIn 2006, Tool released their fourth studio album, 10,000 Days. It topped the US Billboard 200 album chart and was certified platinum by the RIAA, indicating more than one million units sold, a month later. The band toured heavily in support of the album, playing more than 200 shows through 2007. After this, frontman Maynard James Keenan mentioned that he saw Tool breaking up in the near future, and focused on his side-project, Puscifer. However, by early 2008, at the 50th Grammy Awards, Keenan announced to MTV that the band would begin writing new material for their fifth studio album \"right away\".\n\nThe band was quiet over the next few years, only with Tool's website announcing that guitarist Adam Jones, bassist Justin Chancellor, and drummer Danny Carey were working on instrumental material while Keenan focused his efforts on Puscifer. The approach was consistent with what the band had done in the past, with Keenan waiting to write vocals and lyrics until instrumentals were completed. In 2012, the band's website was updated again, with the webmaster writing that they had heard instrumental material that had \"sounded like Tool…some of it reminiscent to earlier Tool stuff, with other parts pushing the envelope\" and that they estimated that the album was around half done.\n\nOutside problems slowed progress on the album over the following years. In 2013, it was reported that two separate scooter accidents injured two undisclosed members of the band, eliminating nine days of planned “jamming” time. Carey later revealed himself as one of the involved members, noting that he had been involved in a motorcycle accident that resulted in multiple cracked ribs, which caused him pain that further slowed recording. Keenan summed up the album's progress at the time in a cooking analogy, explaining that \"Basically right now it's a lot of ideas. There's no actual songs…It's still kind of noodles in a big basket. Lots of noodles, just no dishes.\" In 2014, Jones and Carey revealed that complicated legal issues and court battles stemming from a 2007 lawsuit had been slowing down the process as well. The issues stemmed from a lawsuit from a friend who claimed credit for artwork the band had used, but escalated after an insurance company involved sued the band over technicalities, leading to the band then counter-suing the insurance company. The constant court battles and delays, coupled with other life obligations, limited the band's time for working on music, and drained members of their motivation to be creative and write music. At the time, Carey stated that only one song was “pretty much done”, an untitled ten-minute track. In 2015, Jones announced that the legal issues were completely over.\n\nThe four of us are a lot of fucking work, just to get anywhere, oh my god. Everything’s a fucking committee meeting and it always gets shut down.  success. When you get successful, you think you’re right about everything and you’re pretty sure as that individual — ‘I am right and you are wrong, because I’m successful and we’re successful because of me, not because of you.’ It’s not that bad with us, but there’s a dynamic of like, ‘I want this and I’ve always gotten my way and that’s why we’re successful, because I don’t compromise on this or that.’ I’m the same way. I’m totally the same way.\nMaynard James Keenan, on the creative struggles on writing Fear Inoculum.\nWork on the album continued to progress through 2015, albeit \"slowly\", according to Keenan. Jones reported that the band had 20 different song ideas being developed. The band toured some, and debuted a new track, \"Descending\", albeit in a shortened, incomplete form, according to Jones. Jones also reported that instrumentals had been completed and passed on to Keenan to work on, though he hesitated to call any of the work \"done\". While it was reported in early 2016 by the band's webmaster that it was largely just a few shorter songs and interludes that needed finishing, by the end of the year, Chancellor described the band's status as still \"deep into the writing process”. He explained that while main themes and a loose \"skeleton\" had been established, Jones, Carey, and himself were continually creating and reworking new instrumental content. This work on the album continued throughout 2017. At the time, Carey predicted finishing and releasing in mid-2018, while Keenan countered these claims, stating it would likely take longer than that to finish. Jones, Chancellor, and Carey continued to work on the album while Keenan returned to A Perfect Circle in late 2017 to work with Billy Howerdel to record and release their fourth studio album Eat the Elephant in early 2018. By February 2018, Keenan announced that he had received rough music files from the rest of the band members containing instrumentals labeled \"FINAL\" for all but one track on the album in the prior few months, and had since started writing lyrics and vocal melodies.\n\nRecording\nOn March 10, 2018, Tool entered a major recording studio to start recording sessions with producer Joe Barresi, whom they had worked with on 10,000 Days. On May 11, it was reported that all drum parts had been tracked. In September, Keenan announced he had finished recording scratch vocals, but had not started final vocal takes. In January 2019, Keenan announced that he had finished his final vocal recording sessions \"months ago\", but that the album would still likely require lengthy mixing sessions. In the same month, Carey stated that they aimed to release the album in April 2019, though Keenan countered that this was unrealistic, instead pointing to a release between May and July. The band was in the studio with Bob Ludwig in March 2019; Ludwig had also mastered 10,000 Days.\n\nComposition and themes\nThe album consists of seven main tracks of music, and a run time just short of 80 minutes, the maximum runtime of CDs. The digital version of the album contains three short interlude tracks, stemming from Carey’s scrapped plan to have the album be entirely one long song. Jones and Carey described the songs as lengthy, but containing multiple movements within each track. The concept of seven is a recurring theme of the album both musically and conceptually; Chancellor and Jones wrote guitar riffs in unusual time signatures related to the number seven, while Keenan introduced ideas related to seven as well. Future music videos will also cover the theme. The album also explores the concept of growing \"older and wiser\". Keenan explained that the album covers the idea of \"embracing where we are right now, acknowledging where we've come from and some of the things we've gone through.\" Keenan also advised that patience and multiple listens were required in understanding the album, comparing it to a slowly developing movie. Jones described it as very different from their prior album (10,000 Days). Music critics and journalists have described the album as progressive rock, progressive metal, and alternative metal.","price":19.99,"discount":0.1,"rating":"3.9"},{"id":"9dbd50c2-9f9d-49bc-8b1b-15766de4292a","artist":"Lana Del Rey","name":"Born to Die","year":"2012","cover":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/born-to-die-4f2b7dccc6937.jpg","disc":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/born-to-die-4f3810e1a6a7d.png","genre":"Pop","style":"Rock/Pop","description":"Born to Die is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey.

Compared to her previous albums, especially its somnolent 2015 predecessor, Honeymoon, Lust for Life is positively ebullient in tone, if not in tempo. Lana Del Rey may sing about a \"Summer Bummer\" but the song isn't in sway to a narcotic undertow; it simmers, offering a cool bit of seduction for muggy August nights. LDR retains this delicate balance throughout the lengthy Lust for Life (at 71 minutes, this is an album as playlist, designed to be looped over and over as mood music), never quite succumbing to either despair or ecstasy but rather finding a place where there's no separation between the two emotions. That said, Lana Del Rey does lean toward pleasure on Lust for Life, luxuriating in her slow rhythms and shimmering surfaces. What once seemed icy -- the glassy gloss, the sighing melodies, her persistent murmur -- now exudes warmth, where even the Weeknd's spectral falsetto on the title track feels alluring. LDR manages to sustain this mood over the course of 16 songs, every one of which is a gentle variation of her supple signature. Sometimes, the tracks are graced by a guest -- in addition to the Weeknd, A$AP Rocky shows up on two songs, Sean Ono Lennon on another, while Stevie Nicks stops by for \"Beautiful People Beautiful Problems\" -- but usually what sticks is an escalating chorus or a hook that echoes in the distance. If Lust for Life starts to slow down toward its conclusion -- \"Tomorrow Never Came\" seems like the logical conclusion, but there's a three-track coda afterward -- it nevertheless delivers upon its promise of a sunnier Lana Del Rey, and the very fact that she can find so many textures in a deliberately limited palette is impressive","price":34.99,"discount":0,"rating":"3.2"},{"id":"4ddcdfba-1e17-471c-ac91-edfb44cb2fe4","artist":"Lana Del Rey","name":"Paradise","year":"2012","cover":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/paradise-52e6662656276.jpg","disc":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/e64q5x1724600382.png","genre":"Pop","style":"Rock/Pop","description":"Paradise is the third extended play and second major release by American singer and songwriter Lana Del Rey; it was released on November 9, 2012 by Universal Music.

A cover of Joni Mitchell's 1970 song \"For Free\", featuring American singer-songwriters Zella Day and Weyes Blood, is included in the album.\n\nIn a September 2020 interview with Interview magazine, Del Rey stated that the lyrics of the album pertain to her \"stunning girlfriends\" and \"beautiful siblings\" (\"who so much of the album is about\"), and mentioned \"wanting so much to be normal and realizing that when you have an overactive, eccentric mind, a record like Chemtrails is just what you're going to get.\" A February 2021 interview with Del Rey, for the April 2021 issue of music magazine Mojo, stated \"In 2021,  opens a sunnier chapter in  controversial roman-à-clef, and folk legend Joan Baez advocates her acceptance in the pantheon\", adding that the album \"appears to reveal a more vulnerable Del Rey\" who is \"lighter on the LA menace\" and \"more innocently emotional\" than in her previous work.","price":15.99,"discount":0.3,"rating":"3.1"},{"id":"5923eac5-8168-4808-ae17-332644623bed","artist":"Lana Del Rey","name":"Blue Banisters","year":"2021","cover":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/eecrdh1635012630.jpg","disc":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/qk37y11655374628.png","genre":null,"style":null,"price":29.99,"discount":0.2,"rating":"3.2"},{"id":"eaaa4575-9e21-48fd-acb5-48edc1c0f59a","artist":"Lana Del Rey","name":"Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd","year":"2023","cover":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/sc0gmb1680030127.jpg","disc":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/pmmhuj1710524336.png","genre":"Pop","style":"","description":"Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd is the ninth studio album by American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey, released on March 24, 2023, by Interscope and Polydor Records.

Writing for the album began as early as December 2013 and continued through \"false starts, fruitless detours and stretches of inactivity\" as Lorde stepped back from the public spotlight, taking shape after her breakup from her longtime boyfriend James Lowe in 2015.\n\nMelodrama has been described by critics as a loose concept album that explores the theme of solitude, in the framework of a single house party with the events and moods that entail it. Lorde wrote and produced the album alongside Jack Antonoff, with additional production contributions from Frank Dukes, Malay, Andrew Wyatt, Joel Little and Flume, among others. The album topped charts in New Zealand, Australia, the United States and Canada. Melodrama received widespread acclaim from critics, with some publications citing it as the best album of the year. It also received a Grammy Award nomination for Album of the Year at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nBackground and recording\n\nJack Antonoff (pictured) co-wrote and produced a majority of Melodrama with Lorde.\nIn December 2013, Lorde announced that she had begun writing material for her second studio album. In June 2014, Lorde said that her second studio album was in its early stages and that, so far, it was \"totally different\" from her debut album. In November 2016, Lorde posted a Facebook update that read: \"Writing Pure Heroine was my way of enshrining our teenage glory, putting it up in lights forever so that part of me never dies, and this record – well, this one is about what comes next. ...The party is about to start. I am about to show you the new world.\" Lorde revealed the title of the album on 2 March 2017. The album was recorded over an 18-month period with co-writer and producer Jack Antonoff.\n\nThe album is about a \"grapple with loneliness\" in the aftermath of a break-up, according to The New York Times. In the article, Lorde mentions that \"Melodrama wasn’t a 'breakup album\" and stated that \"it’s a record about being alone. The good parts and the bad parts, dealing with themes of heartbreak and solitude\". She did, however, call \"Green Light\" a traditional break-up song: \"with all of my favorite artists, I’d much rather hear a story about the breakdown of a marriage than do the Googling about it. I love when artists are more mysterious\".\n\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair magazine, Lorde discussed content of the album, as well as the title Melodrama, an allusion to Greek tragedy and performance art. She stated that the title is a \"nod to the types of emotions you experience when you’re 19 or 20. I had such an intense two years, and everything I was feeling—whether it was crying or laughing or dancing or in love—each of them felt like the most concentrated version of that emotion. I also have a love of theater and I love drawing a parallel with Greek tragedies. But there’s definitely an element of tongue-in-cheek; it’s very funny to title your record Melodrama\". Furthermore, she drew comparisons between this album and Pure Heroine, particularly in terms of the stylistic departures between the two: \"it's a little more stylized than the first one. It’s really a collection of moments, thoughts, and vignettes when I said to myself, “Don’t forget this.” And it wasn’t until I went through heartbreak, and moved out of  home into my own house and spent a lot of time totally alone, that I realized I do have very serious, vivid feelings I needed to get out. Working with Jack Antonoff opened me up to feeling a lot; he was the perfect person to help me do that\".\n\nComposition\n\"It's a break-up album, interspersed with a young woman's subsequent pitfalls with parties, emotion-less hook-ups and fame. Her most startling moment is the piano ballad Liability, where Lorde opens up about her intensity driving love away.\"\n—Josh Leeson, The Herald\nLorde composed the songs on Melodrama in New Zealand. She described the album as addressing themes of heartbreak, solitude and loneliness. A majority of the album was written at the piano and took inspiration from Paul Simon's 1986 album, Graceland, Don Henley, Tom Petty, Phil Collins and Joni Mitchell. Lorde worked on the album in Jack Antonoff's home studio in New York City. According to a New York Times article, the singer has a \"neurological condition known as sound-to-color synesthesia\", and devised color codes to each song. It is also noted Lorde wanted to explore a \"cathartic mode\" for the album.\n\nThough it has been denied by Lorde, Melodrama has been described by critics as a loose concept album. Lorde has stated Melodrama only has a loose narrative. It explores the theme of solitude, in the framework of a single house party with the events and moods that entail it. Pitchfork has called the album a \"pop record full of grief and hedonism\". Emily Reily of Paste described it as an \"electropop triumph\".\n\nMelodrama opens with \"Green Light\" which is an electropop, dance-pop, and post-disco song. The song features titular metaphors with reviewers interpreting the \"green light\" as a street signal that gives the singer permission to move on into the future. \"The Louvre\" has been described by Entertainment Weekly as a song about the early stages of a casual relationship \"doomed to fail\". The song starts with Lorde's voice accompanied by a guitar, before becoming \"a storm of glitchy electro-pop\". \"Liability\" is described as a pop piano ballad, with Graeme Tuckett, writing for Stuff New Zealand, stating that \"Liability is a break-up confessional, a diary entry of a song. It reads raw, stripped back, nicely under-produced – just a ballad-ish piano to accompany Lorde's voice this time – and particularly well sung.\" \"Hard Feelings/Loveless\" has been described as a two-part, self-aware breakup song that takes the \"crazy ex-girlfriend\" cliché to \"Fatal Attraction-esque extremes\". Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani described \"Hard Feelings\" as an \"industrial-infused\" song, and \"Loveless\" as \"the most shamelessly poppy track that Lorde has recorded to date, peppered with prickly bon mots\".","price":15.99,"discount":0.15,"rating":"4.2"},{"id":"15262b91-34c5-4c77-b0ad-b491501771f8","artist":"Pink Floyd","name":"Animals","year":"1977","cover":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/d1n20p1612771505.jpg","disc":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/6a42bt1612771525.png","genre":"Progressive Rock","style":"Rock/Pop","description":"Animals is the tenth studio album by English progressive rock group Pink Floyd, released in January 1977.

Animals was recorded at the band's studio, Britannia Row, in London, but its production was punctuated by the early signs of discord that several years later would culminate in keyboardist Richard Wright leaving the band. The album's cover image, a pig floating between two chimneys on Battersea Power Station, was conceived by bassist and writer Roger Waters, and photographed by long-time collaborators Hipgnosis.\nThe album was released to generally positive reviews in the United Kingdom (UK), where it reached #2. It was also a success in the United States (US), reaching #3 on the Billboard 200, and although it scored on the American charts for only six months, steady sales have resulted in its certification by the RIAA at four times platinum.

At the end of 1986 he changed his mind, and decided that the new material would instead be included in a new Pink Floyd album. Subsequently Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright were brought on board for the project. Although for legal reasons Wright could not be re-admitted to the band, he and Mason helped Gilmour to craft what would become the first Pink Floyd album since the departure of lyricist and bass guitarist Roger Waters in December 1985.\nThe album was recorded primarily on Gilmour's converted houseboat, Astoria. Its production was marked by an ongoing legal dispute between Waters and the band as to who owned the rights to Pink Floyd's name, which was not resolved until several months after the album was released. Unlike many of Pink Floyd's studio albums, A Momentary Lapse of Reason has no central theme, and is instead a collection of rock songs written mostly by Gilmour and musician Anthony Moore.\nAlthough the album received mixed reviews and was derided by Waters, with the help of an enormously successful world tour, it easily out-sold their previous album The Final Cut and achieved a certification of quadruple platinum in the US.","price":34.99,"discount":0,"rating":"3.5"},{"id":"1e8a0c67-2365-4c51-8c0c-6b394f651367","artist":"Pink Floyd","name":"Meddle","year":"1971","cover":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/5upqjr1612771863.jpg","disc":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/222nyu1612771880.png","genre":"Progressive Rock","style":"Rock/Pop","description":"Meddle is the sixth studio album by English progressive rock group Pink Floyd, released 30 October 1971 on Harvest Records.

Although many of the group's later albums would be unified by a central theme with lyrics written mainly by Roger Waters, Meddle was a group effort with lyrical contributions from each member. The cover, containing a close-up shot of an ear underwater, was, as with several previous albums, designed by Hipgnosis, though Storm Thorgerson was unhappy with the final result.\nThe album was well received by music critics upon its release.

A remastered CD was released in 1994 in the UK and the US, and again in 2011. Ron Geesin, who had already influenced and collaborated with Roger Waters, made a notable contribution to the album and received a then rare outside songwriting credit.\nThis was the first Pink Floyd album to be specially mixed for 4-channel quadraphonic sound as well as conventional 2-channel stereo. The SQ quadraphonic mix was released on LP in a matrix format compatible with standard stereo record players. There was also a release of the quadraphonic version in the UK in fully discrete 4-channel form on the \"Quad-8\" format, a 4-channel variant of the stereo 8-track tape cartridge.\nThe album cover was, again, designed by Hipgnosis, and was significant in that it was the first one to not feature the band's name on the cover, or contain any photographs of the band anywhere. This was a trend that would continue on subsequent covers throughout the 1970s and beyond.\nAlthough commercially and critically successful on release, the band have expressed several negative opinions of the album in more recent years, particularly from Waters and David Gilmour.

It is the only Pink Floyd album on which Waters is credited for the writing and composition of every song. Most of the lyrics are sung by Waters; lead guitarist David Gilmour provides vocals on only one of the album's tracks.\nThe Final Cut was originally planned as a soundtrack album for the band's 1982 film Pink Floyd-The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed it to be a critique of war, and also what he considered the betrayal of his father. The Final Cut was recorded in eight studios across Britain, from July to December 1982. As with most of Pink Floyd's discography, a range of session musicians were employed as contributors, but its production was dominated by increasing tensions between Waters and his band mates, particularly Gilmour. Keyboardist Richard Wright was at that point no longer a member of the band. The packaging was designed by Waters, and reflects the war theme of the album. It reached the top of the UK Albums Chart, but received mixed reviews. An accompanying short film was later released.\nFollowing the album's release each member of the band concentrated on solo projects, but Waters then announced that he had left the group, and later attempted to keep Gilmour and drummer Nick Mason from using the Pink Floyd name.

The Dark Side of the Moon's themes include conflict, greed, the passage of time and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by Barrett's deteriorating mental state.\n\nThe suite was developed during live performances and was premiered several months before studio recording began. The new material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at Abbey Road Studios in London. The group used some of the most advanced recording techniques of the time, including multitrack recording and tape loops. Analogue synthesisers were given prominence in several tracks, and a series of recorded interviews with the band's road crew and others provided the philosophical quotations used throughout. Engineer Alan Parsons was directly responsible for some of the most notable sonic aspects of the album, and the recruitment of non-lexical performer Clare Torry. The album's iconic sleeve features a prism that represents the band's stage lighting, the record's lyrical themes, and keyboardist Richard Wright's request for a \"simple and bold\" design.\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon was an immediate success, topping the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart for one week.

It explores themes of absence, the music business and former band-mate Syd Barrett's mental decline. Inspired by material the band composed while performing across Europe, Wish You Were Here was recorded in numerous sessions at London's Abbey Road Studios. Although some of these sessions were problematic, it was lead writer Roger Waters' idea to split the centrepiece track \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" in two and join each half with three new compositions. \"Shine On\" was a tribute to Barrett, who, coincidentally, made an impromptu visit to the studio while it was being recorded.\nAs with their previous album, The Dark Side of the Moon, the band made use of studio effects and synthesisers. Roy Harper provided the lead vocals on \"Have a Cigar\". The album's packaging, designed by Storm Thorgerson, featured an opaque black sleeve which hid the album artwork. Wish You Were Here was an instant success and record company EMI was unable to print enough copies to satisfy demand. Although it initially received mixed reviews, the album has since been acclaimed by critics and appears on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\".

Released as a double album on 30 November 1979, it was subsequently performed live with elaborate theatrical effects, and adapted into a feature film, Pink Floyd—The Wall.\n\nAs with the band's previous three LPs, The Wall is a concept album and deals largely with themes of abandonment and personal isolation. It was first conceived during their 1977 In the Flesh Tour, when bassist and lyricist Roger Waters's frustration with the spectators' perceived boorishness became so acute that he imagined building a wall between the performers and audience. The album is a rock opera that centres on Pink, a character Waters modelled after himself, with some aspects based on the band's original leader, Syd Barrett. Pink's life experiences begin with the loss of his father during the Second World War, and continue with ridicule and abuse from his schoolteachers, an overprotective mother and finally, the breakdown of his marriage. All contribute to his eventual self-imposed isolation from society, represented by a metaphorical wall.\n\nThe Wall features a notably harsher and more theatrical style than Pink Floyd's previous releases. Keyboardist Richard Wright left the band during the album's production but remained as a salaried musician, performing with Pink Floyd during The Wall Tour. Commercially successful upon its release, the album was one of the best selling of 1980, and as of 1999, it had sold over 23 million RIAA certified units (11.5 million albums) in the United States.

This was the first time they had done so since the ‘Wish You Were Here’ sessions in the seventies. Those sessions resulted in The Division Bell, the band’s last studio album.\n\nIn 2013 David Gilmour and Nick Mason revisited the music from those sessions and decided that the tracks should be made available as part of the Pink Floyd repertoire. It would be the last time the three of them would be heard together. The band have spent the last year recording and upgrading the music, using the advantages of modern studio technology to create The Endless River.\n\nThe Endless River is a tribute to Rick Wright, whose keyboards are at the heart of the Pink Floyd sound. It is a mainly instrumental album with one song, ‘Louder Than Words’, (with new lyrics by novelist Polly Samson), arranged across four sides and produced by David Gilmour, Phil Manzanera, Youth and Andy Jackson.\n\n‘Louder Than Words’, the new song by Pink Floyd, had its first radio play on BBC Radio 2's Chris Evans show (9 October).\n\n‘Louder Than Words’ is performed by Pink Floyd. Taken from David Gilmour, Rick Wright and Nick Mason's 1993 Division Bell sessions it has new lyrics by writer and Division Bell lyricist Polly Samson.\n\nDavid Gilmour said: \"The music for Louder Than Words is from those final sessions, the three of us playing together on the houseboat Astoria with Rick's idiosyncratic keyboards reminding me now that you don't know what you've got until it's gone. At the start of the album I asked Polly  to write the lyrics. She felt that what I played her didn't need words, that hearing us play was more interesting. In the end she wrote just this one, which expresses, beautifully I think, the way the three of us, me, Nick and Rick have something when we play together, that has a magic that is louder than words\".\n\nRelease date: 10 November 2014\n\nTrack list:\n\n    Things Left Unsaid\n    It's What We Do\n    Ebb and Flow\n    Sum\n    Skins\n    Unsung\n    Anisina\n    The Lost Art of Conversation\n    On Noodle Street\n    Night Light\n    Allons-y (1)\n    Autumn '68\n    Allons-y (2)\n    Talkin' Hawkin'\n    Calling\n    Eyes to Pearls\n    Surfacing\n    Louder Than Words","price":15.99,"discount":0,"rating":"4.7"},{"id":"10b773c4-70e1-4538-827e-5df4eb396c4b","artist":"Fleetwood Mac","name":"Behind the Mask","year":"1990","cover":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/wqvrup1352400135.jpg","disc":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/behind-the-mask-522ff414e6279.png","genre":"Rock","style":"Rock/Pop","description":"Behind the Mask is the 15th studio album by British/American rock band Fleetwood Mac, released in 1990.

Released in 1979, it is considered experimental, primarily due to Lindsey Buckingham's sparser songwriting arrangements and the influence of punk rock and New Wave on his production techniques. Bassist John McVie has commented that the album sounds like \"the work of three solo artists\" (Buckingham, Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie), whilst Mick Fleetwood later proclaimed that it is his favourite and the best Fleetwood Mac studio album created by the group. Costing over one million dollars to record (a fact widely noted in the 1979 press), it was the most expensive rock album made up to that point.\nTusk peaked at #4 in the US and was certified double platinum for shipping two million copies. It peaked at #1 in the UK and achieved a Platinum award for shipments in excess of 300,000 copies. The album gave the group two US top-ten hit singles, with the Buckingham-penned title track (US #8/UK #6), and the Stevie Nicks composition \"Sara\" (US #7/UK #37). Further releases from the album, \"Not That Funny\" (UK only single release), \"Think About Me\" and \"Sisters of the Moon\" were less successful; however, the latter two appear in their 'single versions' on the 2002 compilation The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac. \"Sara\" was cut to 4Â½ minutes for both the single and the first CD release of the album, but the unedited version has since been restored on the 1988 Greatest Hits compilation and the 2004 reissue of Tusk as well as Fleetwood Mac's 2002 release of The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac. Original guitarist Peter Green also took part in the sessions for Tusk, but his playing on the Christine McVie track \"Brown Eyes\" is not credited on the album.\nThough the album sold four million copies worldwide, in comparison to the huge sales of Rumours and the unprecedented recording expense, the band's record label deemed the project a failure, laying the blame squarely with Buckingham himself. Fleetwood, however, blames the album's relative failure on the RKO radio chain playing the album in its entirety prior to release, thus allowing mass home taping. In addition, Tusk was a double album, with a high list price of $15.98.\nThe band embarked on a huge 18-month tour to promote Tusk. They travelled extensively across the world, including the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. In Germany they shared the bill with reggae superstar Bob Marley. It was on this world tour that the band recorded music for the Fleetwood Mac Live album, which was released at the end of 1980.","price":15.99,"discount":0.25,"rating":"3.5"},{"id":"ca58be5a-7714-4939-af51-8b1b80e77b34","artist":"Fleetwood Mac","name":"Mr. Wonderful","year":"1968","cover":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/xwpqtq1505557295.jpg","disc":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/mr-wonderful-56da5c3a5cded.png","genre":"Rock","style":"Rock/Pop","description":"Released in 1968, Mr. Wonderful is the second album by the blues-rock band, Fleetwood Mac.

The record peaked at the top of both the main United States Billboard chart and the United Kingdom Albums Chart. \"Go Your Own Way\", \"Don't Stop\", \"Dreams\", and \"You Make Loving Fun\" were released as singles. A Grammy Award winner, Rumours is Fleetwood Mac's most successful release with sales of over 40 million copies worldwide.\nThe band wanted to expand on the commercial success of the 1975 record Fleetwood Mac, but struggled with relationship breakups before recording started. The Rumours studio sessions were marked by hedonistic behaviour and interpersonal strife between Fleetwood Mac members; these experiences informed the album's lyrics. Influenced by pop music, the record's tracks were recorded using a combination of acoustic and electric instruments. The mixing process delayed the completion of Rumours, but was finished by the end of 1976. Following the album's release in 1977, Fleetwood Mac undertook worldwide promotional tours.\nRumours garnered widespread critical acclaim. Praise centred on its production quality and harmonies, which frequently relied on the interplay among three vocalists. The record has inspired the work of musical acts in different genres. Often considered Fleetwood Mac's best release, it has featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 1970s and the best albums of all time.

It was the first of their original albums to feature Danny Kirwan and the last with Peter Green. Jeremy Spencer did not feature on the album apart from \"a couple of piano things\" (according to Mick Fleetwood in Q magazine in 1990). The record, appearing after the group's sudden success in the pop charts, offered a broader stylistic range than the classic blues of the group's first two albums. The title is taken from Duke Orsino's opening line, \"If music be the food of love, play on,\" from William Shakespeare's comedy play Twelfth Night.\nThis was the band's first release with Warner/Reprise after being lured away from Blue Horizon and a one-off with Immediate Records. Forty years on, Fleetwood Mac remain with Warner. The album, which at its original UK release had an unusually long running time, has been released with four different song lineups. The currently-available CD compiles all songs from the two US LP versions, both of which omitted tracks from the original UK version.","price":24.99,"discount":0,"rating":"3.1"},{"id":"35ad1648-642e-4228-8fc2-112cf0db7979","artist":"Fleetwood Mac","name":"Mirage","year":"1982","cover":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/vj6dde1605169221.jpg","disc":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/noxvcx1605169201.png","genre":"Rock","style":"Rock/Pop","description":"Mirage is the 13th studio album by Fleetwood Mac, released on June 18, 1982.\n\nFollowing a hiatus of over a year after the completion of the worldwide Tusk tour, the band temporarily relocated to Château d'Hérouville in France to record this 12-track collection. By this time Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham had each commenced a solo side-career, the former to multi-platinum #1 success with 1981's Bella Donna, the latter faring not as well with his first outing Law and Order (US Billboard #32).\n\nMirage found the band venturing further into radio-friendly soft rock than it had in any of its previous incarnations. It stood in stark contrast to its highly experimental predecessor, 1979's Tusk. Mirage yielded several hit singles: \"Hold Me\" (which peaked at #4 on the U.S. Billboard Pop Chart, remaining there for seven weeks), \"Love in Store\" (#22 US Pop Chart), \"Oh Diane\" (which reached #9 in the UK), and finally, \"Can't Go Back\" (issued on 7\" and 12\" in the UK).\n\nThe Stevie Nicks composition \"Gypsy\" (#12 Pop, #4 Rock, and a #1 hit in Canada) was the second single from the album and was accompanied by a lengthy video, the highest-budget music video ever produced at the time, directed by Russell Mulcahy, and was the very first \"World Premiere Video\" on MTV in 1982. The single and album edit of \"Gypsy\" ran for only 4:24, but a 5½-minute version had been originally recorded and it was this version used for the video. This full-length version was not made available on CD until 1992's retrospective box set 25 Years – The Chain.\n\nOf the other two compositions from Nicks on the album, \"That's Alright\" dated back to the Buckingham/Nicks days of 1974, whilst \"Straight Back\" was written in the winter of 1981 and referred to her separation from (then) lover, producer Jimmy Iovine, and the huge wrench she experienced having to leave her newly established and highly successful solo career to re-join Fleetwood Mac for the 1982 project (Nicks refers to this on the DVD commentary to her 2008 retrospective Crystal Visions – The Very Best of Stevie Nicks). \"Straight Back\" was also a US radio hit in winter 1982.\n\nThe album was certified double platinum for shipping 2,000,000 copies in the US and returned the group to the top of the U.S. charts for the first time since their 1977 hit album Rumours, spending five weeks at the top. It also reached #5 in the UK where it was certified platinum for shipping 300,000 copies, and #2 in Australia. The album entered the 'Billboard top 200 albums chart' at #50, it then climbed to #9 the following week, #3 in its third week and began its five-week run at #1 in its fourth week. After five weeks at the top, in its ninth week it fell to #2 where it stayed for eleven weeks. In its twentieth week, the album fell to #13 and dropped to #14 the next week. In its twenty-second week, 'Mirage' plummeted to #33 and fell further the next week to #53. 'Mirage' spent 35 weeks in the top 100, 22 weeks in the top 40 and 19 weeks in the top 10.","price":19.99,"discount":0,"rating":"3.7"},{"id":"9d33cb4b-fc2e-4362-9dc2-f7b6a460ea3a","artist":"Stevie Nicks","name":"Trouble in Shangri-La","year":"2001","cover":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/trouble-in-shangri-la-526ae188ea759.jpg","disc":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/trouble-in-shangri-la-54dbac5716838.png","genre":"Pop-Rock","style":"Rock/Pop","description":"Trouble in Shangri-La is the sixth studio album by American singer-songwriter and Fleetwood Mac vocalist Stevie Nicks.

The album was also preceded by two singles, the first studio recordings that Gillan made with Deep Purple. The first single, released in 1969, was a Greenaway-Cook composition called \"Hallelujah\", which flopped. The second single, \"Black Night\", fared much better as it rose all the way to #2 on the UK charts.\n\nIn 2005 the album won the Classic Rock Roll Of Honour Award (given by the British monthly magazine Classic Rock) in the category Classic Album.

It was released on April 16, 2021. The album's first single, \"My Way, Soon\", was released ahead of the album in October 2020, and topped the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart in January 2021.\n\nBackground and recording\nThe band commenced on writing material for a second studio album directly after finishing their debut album, Anthem of the Peaceful Army, which released in October 2018. As early as January 2019, bassist Sam Kiszka indicated that the album was scheduled for sometime in 2019 as well. Recording sessions occurred in a concentrated 2 month period in mid-2019. The album was recorded with musical producer Greg Kurstin, who most recently worked with Foo Fighters on Concrete and Gold and Medicine at Midnight.\n\nThemes and composition\nEarly 2019 commentary from the band on the album noted that it would be thematically have a \"more worldly\" feel than their prior work, inspired by the band's seeing the world through touring. Additionally, they aimed to create \"an evolution to their sound\" after their prior album received a lot of commentary, both positive and negative, of being very similar to the work of Led Zeppelin. Upon the reveal of the album's name of The Battle at Garden's Gate in late 2020, they expanded on the themes, noting that it was \"definitely a biblical reference\" but that the album expanded well beyond that, into the idea of \"ancient civilizations\" and \"parallel universe\". The band explores the human experience, and how religion and war affect it. The album was described as more dark, cinematic, and complicated than their prior album. Seeing dark instances of poverty and famine while touring inspired its more dire sound.\n\nRelease and promotion\nThe band released their first single from the album, \"My Way, Soon\", in October 2020. The song was debuted and performed live on December 8 on the The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, complete with costumes and stage setup similar to 1970's music programs. A second song, \"Age of Machine\", was released in December 2020. In January, \"My Way, Soon\" topped the Billboard Mainstream Rock songs chart, their fifth song to top the chart.","price":15.99,"discount":0.1,"rating":"5.0"},{"id":"db0777b3-b6a4-47d2-9a4d-9373a5d87de9","artist":"Greta Van Fleet","name":"Starcatcher","year":"2023","cover":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/7r4qca1690290465.jpg","disc":"https://r2.TheAudioDB.com/images/media/album/cdart/gqaddo1755458728.png","genre":"Hard Rock","style":"","description":"Starcatcher is the third studio album by American rock band Greta Van Fleet.

Records. A two-disc Special Edition was also released in June 2001 to promote the Drowned World Tour, containing an additional CD of remixes and the video of \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\".\n\nMadonna collaborated with French producer Mirwais AhmadzaÃ¯ for this album. Music is rooted in electronic and dance-pop music; however, the album also contains elements of rock, country and folk. Upon its release, the album received positive reviews from critics, who praised Madonna's collaboration with Mirwais, as well as the album's musical creativity. It was nominated for a total of five Grammy Awards although it eventually won only one award for \"Best Recording Package\". The album is also listed by Rolling Stone magazine as one of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Commercially, Music debuted at number one in over 23 countries around the world and sold more than four million copies in the first ten days. Worldwide sales of the album have surpassed 15 million copies.\n\nMusic spawned three singles and one promotional single. The title track reached the top of the charts in 25 countries and became Madonna's 12th and last number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100; it also earned a positive critical reception, being listed by Rolling Stone as one of the best songs of the 2000s and received two Grammy Award nominations. The next single, \"Don't Tell Me\", was also commercially successful, reaching number one in Canada, Italy and New Zealand. \"What It Feels Like For A Girl\" also did well commercially, reaching the top ten in the UK, Italy, New Zealand and other countries, yet it failed to reach the top twenty in the US, peaking at twenty-three. Its accompanying video generated controversy, with critics deeming it to be violent, and it was banned from US MTV. \"Impressive Instant\", a promotional single, was also released in 2001 as a club single, which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs.\n\nAlongside Ray of Light, Music was promoted by the Drowned World Tour, which was critically acclaimed and commercially successful, grossing around $75 million, making it the fourth highest-grossing tour of 2001, and receiving two nominations at the 2001 Pollstar Concert Industry Awards. The album was further promoted by the Don't Tell Me Promo Tour, a promotional tour consisting of two concerts.

It was released on November 11, 2005 by Warner Bros. Records. The album was a complete departure from her previous studio album American Life (2003). The album includes influences of 70s and 80s disco, as well as modern-day club music. Initially, she began working with Mirwais AhmadzaÃ¯ and recorded two tracks for the album. Madonna felt that their collaboration was not going in the direction she desired. Madonna took her collaboration with Stuart Price who was overviewing her documentary I'm Going to Tell You a Secret. Being tired of all the political diatribes she had included in her previous works, Madonna felt the need to relax and be in a happy mood. The album was mainly recorded at Price's home-studio where Madonna spent most of her time during the recordings.\n\nMusically the album is structured like a DJ's set. The songs are sequenced and blended together so that they are played continuously without any gaps. The title arrived from the fact that the tracklisting for the album consists of light-hearted and happy songs in the beginning, and progresses to much darker melodies and lyrics describing personal feelings and commitments. Songs on the album use samples and references of music by other dance-oriented artists like ABBA, Donna Summer, Pet Shop Boys, Bee Gees, and Depeche Mode. Madonna incorporated references of her older work as well. One of the tracks, \"Isaac\", was not well received by some Israeli rabbis who claimed that the song was about their noted sixteenth-century Kabbalah scholar Yitzhak Luria. Madonna explained that the song was named after Yitzhak Sinwani, who appeared as a featured vocalist for the song.\n\nContemporary critics lauded the album calling it a return to form for Madonna. They complimented the fact that Madonna chose to seek inspiration from the dance music which had made her the noted star she is. Price's musical direction was also praised. Madonna was honored with a Grammy Award for \"Best Dance/Electronic Album\" in 2007, as well as \"International Female Solo Artist\" at the 2006 BRIT Awards. After its release, Confessions on a Dance Floor peaked at number one in 40 countries, earning a place in the 2007 Guinness Book of World Records as the album topping the charts in most countries. Released in mid-November of 2005, the album's success was such that it still ranked as the sixth biggest-selling of the year. Worldwide sales of Confessions on a Dance Floor stand at ten million copies.\n\nFour singles were released from the album. \"Hung Up\", the first single, became Madonna's most successful single worldwide by topping the charts in a total of 41 countries. It was followed by \"Sorry\" which was another chart topping success. It became Madonna's twelfth number-one single in the United Kingdom. \"Get Together\" and \"Jump\" were released as the third and fourth singles respectively, both becoming successful on the dance charts. The album was promoted on the 2006 Confessions Tour, which became the highest grossing tour ever for a female artist at that time.","price":19.99,"discount":0,"rating":"3.3"},{"id":"90420983-cd00-493c-ae9e-24d2a4c9b6f1","artist":"Madonna","name":"Like a Prayer","year":"1989","cover":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/wb8s8k1610267730.jpg","disc":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/bpef9u1610267742.png","genre":"Pop","style":"Rock/Pop","description":"Like a Prayer is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter Madonna, released on March 21, 1989 by Sire Records, three years after her previous studio album. Madonna worked with Stephen Bray, Patrick Leonard, and fellow icon Prince on the album while co-writing and co-producing all the songs. As Madonna's most introspective release at the time, Like a Prayer has been described as a confessional record. She described the album as a collection of songs \"about my mother, my father, and bonds with my family.\" The album was dedicated to her mother, who died when Madonna was young.\n\nThe album uses live instrumentation and incorporates elements of dance, funk, gospel, and soul into a more general pop style. Madonna drew from her Catholic upbringing, as seen in the album's title track and lead single \"Like a Prayer\". The lyrics deals with themes from Madonna's childhood and adolescence, such as the death of her mother in \"Promise to Try\", the importance of family in \"Keep It Together\", and her relationship with her father in \"Oh Father\". Madonna also preaches female empowerment in \"Express Yourself\". Upon its release, Like a Prayer was mostly praised by music critics. Rolling Stone hailed it as \"...as close to art as pop music gets.\"\n\nCommercially, Like a Prayer became an international success like its predecessors, reaching the top of the charts in multiple territories. The album was certified quadruple platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America. Six singles were released from the album: \"Like a Prayer\", \"Express Yourself\", \"Cherish\", \"Oh Father\", \"Dear Jessie\", and \"Keep It Together\". \"Like a Prayer\" became Madonna's seventh number-one on the Billboard Hot 100, while \"Express Yourself\" and \"Cherish\" peaked at number-two. Worldwide the album has sold over 15 million copies.\n\nWith the singles' accompanying music videos, Madonna furthered her creativity and became known as a leading figure in the format. The music video for \"Like a Prayer\" was a lightning rod for religious controversy, using Catholic iconography such as stigmata and burning crosses, and a dream about making love to a saint, leading the Vatican to condemn the video and causing Pepsi to cancel Madonna's sponsorship contract. \"Express Yourself\" was the most expensive music video ever made at the time. The album preceded Madonna's ground-breaking Blond Ambition World Tour. At the end of the 1980s, following the release of Like a Prayer, Madonna was named as the \"Artist of the Decade\" by media such as Billboard, MTV, and Musician magazine.","price":34.99,"discount":0,"rating":"4.5"},{"id":"89d1c733-7b53-4719-9344-d6314f6111c8","artist":"Madonna","name":"Erotica","year":"1992","cover":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/vyuyus1341911926.jpg","disc":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/erotica-4f209363da229.png","genre":"Pop","style":"Rock/Pop","description":"Erotica is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Madonna, released on October 20, 1992 by Maverick Records, three years after her previous studio album. Madonna worked mostly with Shep Pettibone, as well as André Betts. Famously released simultaneously with Madonna's first book publication, Sex, the album is driven by its sexual themes. It is Madonna's first album to feature a Parental Advisory sticker.\n\nThe album incorporates influences from house music, new jack swing, and lounge music. Many of the songs see Madonna at her most provocative, drawing from themes of sex and romance, such as the lead single and title track \"Erotica\". Madonna was also inspired by the idea of homosexuality, particularly in the album's second single \"Deeper and Deeper\". Others take on a more confessional tone, influenced by the loss of two of Madonna's close friends to the AIDS epidemic. Visually, Madonna was inspired by the works of Andy Warhol and BDSM culture. Erotica was met with generally favorable reviews from critics. Rolling Stone described the album as \"a post-AIDS album about romance.\"\n\nCommercially, the album failed to live up to the success of its predecessors, possibly owing to the negative backlash surrounding the album's sexuality. Peaking at number two on the Billboard 200, the album was certified double-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. It peaked in the top five in most territories, topping the charts in Australia. Six singles were released from the album-\"Erotica\", \"Deeper and Deeper\", \"Bad Girl\", \"Fever\", \"Rain\" and \"Bye Bye Baby\". The album failed to produce any number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. Worldwide the album has sold over 5 million copies.\n\nThe Erotica era has more recently been seen as one of Madonna's most important owing to the controversy surrounding it.

Madonna collaborated with Dallas Austin, Babyface, Dave \"Jam\" Hall and Nellee Hooper, deciding to move into a more R&B direction. Madonna tried to soften her image after releasing several sexually explicit works earlier in the decade.\n\nThe album was inspired by contemporary R&B and new jack swing, developing a generally more mainstream, radio-friendly sound. Like its predecessor Erotica (1992), Bedtime Stories explores lyrical themes of love, sorrow, and romance, but with a toned-down, less sexual approach. Critics described the album as \"autobiographical\". The album's final single \"Human Nature\" addresses the controversy surrounding Erotica, while \"Bedtime Story\" was written by Icelandic singer-songwriter Björk. Bedtime Stories received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who praised the album's candid lyrics and production.\n\nCommercially, the album proved to be successful.

It was re-released worldwide in 1985, with the inclusion of the bonus track \"Into the Groove\". In 2001, Warner Bros. Records released a remastered version with two bonus remix tracks. After the release of her self-titled debut album, Madonna wanted to solidify her future in the music business, by building on the success of the first album. She decided to become one of the record producers, but Warner Bros. was not ready to give her the artistic freedom that she wanted. Nile Rodgers was chosen as the primary producer of the album, due to his work with David Bowie.\n\nThe album was recorded at Power Station Studio in New York at a quick pace. Rodgers enlisted the help of his former Chic band mates Bernard Edwards, who was the bassist, and Tony Thompson, who played drums; they appeared on several tracks of the album. Rodgers decided to be the guitarist, when Edwards requested him to do so, in exchange of their help. Jason Corsaro, the record's audio engineer, persuaded Rodgers to use digital recording, a new technique introduced at that time. The cover sleeve and images were shot by Steven Meisel. Madonna wanted the album title and the cover image to make provocative link between her own religious name Madonna, as the Roman Catholic title for Jesus' mother Mary, and the Christian concept of the virgin birth.\n\nLike a Virgin is not that much of a musical departure from Madonna's first album, but she felt that the material was stronger. Along with Rodgers, Madonna also collaborated with her former boyfriend Steve Bray, who co-wrote many songs on the album. Consisting of dance-pop oriented music, the songs also incorporated New Wave. After its release, Like a Virgin received mixed reviews from the critics, but was a commercial success. It became Madonna's first number one album on the Billboard 200, while reaching the top of the charts in Germany, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the United Kingdom. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it diamond for shipment of ten million copies across the United States. Worldwide it has sold 21 million copies, becoming one of the best-selling albums of all time.\n\nFive singles were released from the album, with \"Like a Virgin\", \"Material Girl\" and \"Into the Groove\" becoming worldwide hits. To promote the album, Madonna embarked on The Virgin Tour, which had shows in cities of North America only. Like a Virgin has attained significance as a cultural artifact of the 80s. Madonna proved that she was not a one-hit wonder and was able to provide herself with a permanent footing in the music world. Her songs became a lightning rod for both criticism by conservatives and imitation by the younger female population, especially \"Material Girl\" and \"Like a Virgin\". According to author J. Randy Taraborrelli, \"Every important artist has at least one album in his or her career whose critical and commercial success becomes the artist's magic moment; for Madonna, Like a Virgin was just such a defining moment\".","price":19.99,"discount":0.3,"rating":"4.9"},{"id":"84826acf-4a56-46fe-b62e-bdb0bfb11158","artist":"Madonna","name":"Ray of Light","year":"1998","cover":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/rqyyyx1341912123.jpg","disc":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/ray-of-light-4f0506ac76bfa.png","genre":"Pop","style":"Rock/Pop","description":"Ray of Light is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Madonna, released on March 3, 1998 by Maverick Records.

Following failed sessions with other producers, Madonna pursued a new musical direction with Orbit. The album is a pop and dance record, yet, it contains elements of electronic music within its composition, making it a departure from her previous work. Additionally, it incorporates several genres and subgenres, including techno and ambient. The album has several themes, including spirituality.\nUpon release, the album received acclaim and was lauded by contemporary critics as a masterpiece. Reviewers commended the singer's new musical direction, calling it her \"most adventurous\" record, as well as its mature, restrained nature; the singer's vocals were also praised. Ray of Light won four Grammy Awards from a total of six nominations. Commercially, the album was a success, peaking at number one in numerous countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. On the US Billboard 200, the album debuted and peaked at number two.\n\nFive singles were released from the album, including global top-five hits \"Frozen\" and \"Ray of Light\". The former became Madonna's first number one debut in the United Kingdom and gave her a record for most number-two hits in the history of the Billboard Hot 100. In order to support the album, Madonna embarked on the Drowned World Tour in 2001. Critics and scholars have noted the album's influence on popular music, especially how it helped bring electronic music into mainstream pop culture. They also noted the way in which Madonna was able to re-invent herself and remain fresh and contemporary amidst the more teen pop-based music of the period. In such a way, the album has been included in many critic lists and polls, including Rolling Stone magazine's \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\".

She worked with Stephen Bray and Patrick Leonard on the album while co-writing and co-producing all the songs. Deemed as Madonna's most girlish album, True Blue deals with her visions of love, work, dreams as well as disappointments, and was inspired by her then husband Sean Penn, to whom Madonna dedicated the album. Musically, the songs on the album took a different direction from her previous endeavours, incorporating classical music in order to engage an older audience who had been skeptical of her music.\n\nThe album features instrumentation from acoustic guitars, drums, synthesizers and Cuban musical instruments. The topic for the songs range from love, freedom, and in the case of \"Papa Don't Preach\", social issues like teenage pregnancy. After its release, True Blue received generally positive reviews from critics. They complimented the album, with one calling it great dance-pop, and described it as the archetype of the late '80s and early '90s pop albums. They also praised the fact that Madonna's voice sounded stronger than it did on her previous efforts, while commending Madonna's skills as a singer, songwriter and entertainer.\n\nTrue Blue was an immediate global success, reaching number one in then record-breaking 28 countries across the world, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. It spent 34 consecutive weeks at the top of the European Top 100 Albums chart, longer than any other album in history. It became the world's top-selling album of 1986 and remains one of the best-selling albums of all time with sales of more than 25 million copies worldwide. All five singles released from the album reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100, with \"Live to Tell\", \"Papa Don't Preach\", and \"Open Your Heart\" peaking at number one.\n\nThe album was promoted on Madonna's second concert tour, Who's That Girl World Tour, which visited cities of North America, Europe and Asia in 1987. The album's singles and their accompanying music videos have sparked debates among scholars and social groups, especially \"Papa Don't Preach\" for the theme of teenage pregnancy in its lyrics and \"Open Your Heart\" for portraying a minor entering a strip club in its music video. True Blue is credited as being the album which made Madonna truly into a superstar and cemented her reputation among the consummate musical figures of the 1980s. The album also gave her first appearance on the Guinness Book of World Records.","price":34.99,"discount":0,"rating":"4.0"},{"id":"d10ba928-fea0-46e7-9732-1555db08433a","artist":"Madonna","name":"Madonna","year":"1983","cover":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/pxqnjl1610267910.jpg","disc":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/madonna-507ae25b7f313.png","genre":"Pop","style":"Rock/Pop","description":"Madonna is the self-titled debut album by American singer-songwriter Madonna, released on July 27, 1983 by Sire Records. The album was re-released in 1985 for the European market and re-packaged as The First Album. In 1982, while establishing herself as a singer in Downtown New York, Madonna met Seymour Stein, president of Sire Records, who signed her after listening to her single \"Everybody\". The success of the single prompted Sire to sign her for an album's deal. For the album, Madonna chose to work with Reggie Lucas, a Warner Bros. producer. However, she was not happy with the completed tracks and disagreed with Lucas's production techniques, so decided to seek additional help with the production.\n\nMadonna then invited her boyfriend at the time, John \"Jellybean\" Benitez, to help her finish the album. Benitez remixed many of the tracks and produced \"Holiday\". The overall sound of Madonna is dissonant, and is in the form of upbeat synthetic disco, utilizing some of the new technology of the time, like the usage of Linn drum machine, Moog bass and the Oberheim OB-X synthesizer. The songs on the album are sung by Madonna in a bright, girlish vocal timbre, and lyrically talks about love and relationships.\n\nContemporary critics have applauded the album, but Madonna was dismissed by some critics when it was released in 1983. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly named it as the fifth of \"Top 100 Best Albums of Past 25 Years.\" The album was successful on the charts, reaching number eight on the Billboard 200, and the top ten of the charts in Australia, France, Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom. It was certified five-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipment of five million copies across the United States. Worldwide the album has sold more than ten million copies.\n\nFive singles were released from the album, with \"Holiday\" becoming her first song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, and \"Lucky Star\", her first top-five hit. The album was promoted by The Virgin Tour in 1985. Madonna has often remarked that she wished she had more variety in the songs of the album, and had more creative control. However, critics and scholars have credited the album for popularizing dance music as mainstream genre. It set the standard for dance-pop and pointed musical direction for a host of female artists. The album is also noted for heralding Madonna's arrival in the music scene and launching her career as a disco diva.","price":29.99,"discount":0.2,"rating":"4.5"},{"id":"8f3673c4-d189-430d-b1c0-808eaf8f6ddf","artist":"Madonna","name":"American Life","year":"2003","cover":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/american-life-4fc360f4baed1.jpg","disc":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/american-life-4fc65edb0795d.png","genre":"Pop","style":"Rock/Pop","description":"American Life is the ninth studio album by American singer-songwriter Madonna. It was released on April 22, 2003 by Maverick Records and distributed by Warner Bros. Records. The album produced in its entirety by Madonna and Mirwais AhmadzaÃ¯ featured references to many parts of American culture. The album is considered a concept album, with recurring themes of \"American Dream\" and \"materialism\". Furthermore, the themes reject the reputation Madonna held in the 1980s with her worldwide hit \"Material Girl\". American Life is a folk album in its purest definition, instead of a general pop record. The album also contains rock and electronica music, as well as influences of acoustic music on many tracks.\n\nThe album peaked at number one in fourteen countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom. It was nominated for two Grammys at the 46th Grammy Awards. The record was the world's 32nd-best-selling album in 2003. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and British Phonographic Industry (BPI) both certified it platinum in recognition of one million shipments in the US, and three hundred thousand shipments in the UK, respectively. It is the second Madonna Album to have a Parental Advisory sticker, after Erotica. Generally critic opinion was mixed with responses noting the \"warmer sounds\" as well as several critics noting the \"innovation\" at a time of R&B dominance, but general responses calling the record uninspired and uninteresting.\n\nFour singles were released from the album. The first, the title track was released to a mixed critical reception with Blender naming it as the ninth worst song of all time. A controversial music video was pulled after scenes of war and violence were criticized which led to an edited version being released, charting at number 37 in the US elsewhere it entered the top ten in most countries placing at number two in the UK. The second \"Hollywood\" became her first to miss out on the Billboard Hot 100. A music video directed by Jean-Baptiste Mondino was subject of a lawsuit for plagiarism from French fashion photographer Guy Bourdin. The third \"Nothing Fails\" featured a lack of promotion resulting in a poor commercial performance, topping the charts in Spain, it once again missed out on the Billboard Hot 100. The final \"Love Profusion\" featured a music video directed by Luc Besson but once again failed commercially charting poorly in most countries whilst once again topping the Spanish Singles Chart.\n\nPromotion for the album took place in a small promotional tour between April and May 2003 before she ventured upon her sixth concert tour, the Re-Invention World Tour. The tour was divided into five segments: French Baroque-Marie Antoinette Revival, Military-Army, Circus-Cabaret, Acoustic and Scottish-Tribal, gaining positive responses controversy arose over a statement by recording artist Elton John after he stated she was lip-synching. The tour was chronicled in a documentary titled I'm Going to Tell You a Secret. A CD+DVD was also released along with the film. At the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards Madonna performed alongside artists; Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Missy Elliot in a medley of, \"Like a Virgin\" and \"Hollywood\" and engaged in open-mouth kissing with Aguilera and Spears gaining great controversy and publicity.","price":24.99,"discount":0,"rating":"4.5"},{"id":"9810adaa-079b-4a0d-8343-4a9d37e26291","artist":"Madonna","name":"Hard Candy","year":"2008","cover":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/hard-candy-4f67b59057b39.jpg","disc":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/hard-candy-4fc65d70a41bb.png","genre":"Pop","style":"Rock/Pop","description":"Hard Candy is the eleventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Madonna, released on April 19, 2008, by Warner Bros. Records. It was her final studio album with the record company, marking the end of a 25 year recording history. Madonna started working on the album in 2007, and collaborated with Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, Pharrell Williams and Nate \"Danja\" Hills. The album has an overall R&B vibe, while remaining a dance-pop record at its core. Pet Shop Boys were also asked to collaborate with Madonna on the album by Warner Bros. but the record company later changed their mind and withdrew their invitation.\n\nMadonna became interested in collaborating with Timberlake after hearing his 2006 album FutureSex/LoveSounds. Together they developed a number of songs for the album, but the basis of the development was Williams' demos. Madonna had a number of songs written down for the album, which amazed Timberlake. They had intensive discussions among themselves before recording a song. Later, Madonna recalled that most of the songs on Hard Candy were autobiographical in many respects. However, according to her this was not intentional and happened while she was in the process of developing the album.\n\nMadonna had initially decided to portray herself as the Black Madonna for the cover art, and call it the same, but later felt the idea may have been seen as controversial. She instead named the album \"Hard Candy\" which refers to the juxtaposition of toughness and sweetness. Critical reaction to the album was generally favorable, though some reviewers condemned it for its attempt to harness the urban market. On release Hard Candy debuted at number one in 37 countries worldwide, including the United States, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom and became the eleventh best selling album worldwide of 2008. Worldwide the album has sold more than four million copies.\n\nThree singles were released from the album. The first, \"4 Minutes\", was a worldwide success, topping the charts in 21 countries and becoming Madonna's 37th Billboard Hot 100 top-ten hit. Other singles released were \"Give It 2 Me\" and \"Miles Away\". To promote the album, Madonna went on a small promotional tour, where she played in three cities in small venues.

As well as Madonna producing the album she worked with a variety of producers such as Alle Benassi, Benny Benassi, Demolition Crew, Free School, Michael Malih, Indiigo, William Orbit, Martin Solveig.\nThe album received generally positive reviews from music critics.

It was released on March 6, 2015 by Interscope Records. After a flurry of unexpected album content leaks, including thirteen early demos in December 2014, the record's release was locked in for March 2015, and six of its tracks were officially released onto iTunes on December 20, 2014. On the same day, \"Living for Love\" was released as the album's lead single.\nFollowing the release of her twelfth studio album, MDNA (2012), Madonna embarked on The MDNA Tour to promote it. The tour visited America, Europe, the Middle East and a number of new venues, but courted many controversial subjects such as violence, firearms, human rights, nudity and politics. Lawsuits threatened against Madonna were also engaged from the concerts. Madonna was enraged by many of these incidents, which she claimed was \"injustice\" against human beings. These included the imprisonment of Yulia Tymoshenko in Ukraine and Pussy Riot in Russia, gay rights violations, presidential election in the United States and the assassination attempt of Malala Yousafzai. In September 2013, she released secretprojectrevolution, a short film directed by her and Steven Klein, dealing with artistic freedom and human rights. The film also launched a global initiative called Art for Freedom to promote freedom of expression.\n\nMadonna's manager, Guy Oseary, commented that the singer was \"eager to get started\" on her next album. In February 2014, Madonna confirmed that she had already begun working on her thirteenth studio album, saying that she was \"right now in the process of talking to various co-writers and producers and talking about where I want to go with my music\". But she refrained from divulging the name of the collaborators, stating that it was \"top secret\". Madonna confirmed in the cover story of L'Uomo Vogue in May 2014 that the album would be connected with Art for Freedom, saying that she \"had\" to be committed to the initiative since \"At this point, there's no turning back. This is my role in the world, my work as an artist. I have a voice and I have to use it\". However, working with many collaborators posed a problem for Madonna to keep cohesion with the sound and the direction of Rebel Heart, since her previous efforts have been with only a core group of people developing the music. She observed that a lot of the young people she enlisted would not stay in one city at a time due to their different projects, resulting in Madonna not finishing her songs. Although she would have a number of ideas, it was a \"chaotic way to work\" for the singer due to the confusion surrounding the schedule. \"So, I was just the person standing there with a clipboard in the headlights, going 'Ok!'

It was released on June 14, 2019, on Interscope Records. The album follows Rebel Heart (2015) and its first single \"Medellín\" was released on April 17, 2019. Another single, \"Crave\", followed on May 10, 2019.\n\nBackground and development\nIn January 2018, Madonna announced on Instagram that she had begun working on her fourteenth studio album. Four months later, in May 2018, she performed at the Met Gala in New York. As part of her performance of her hit single \"Like a Prayer\", Madonna sang a short segment from a brand new song known as \"Dark Ballet\" (previously known as \"Beautiful Game\"). In October 2018, she was featured on the song \"Champagne Rosé\" by rapper Quavo, who in return became her collaborator on this album.\n\nI started getting invited to people's homes and they have things called living room sessions. So everyone would congregate. People would bring wine, they would bring food, sit around the table. And then suddenly musicians would get up and start playing instruments and singing fado music and morna music and samba music. I was like, 'Wait. What's going on here? Like artists just get up and perform and you don't get paid and they're just doing it for fun and love and passion?\nMadonna relocated to Lisbon, Portugal in 2017, seeking a top football academy for boys for her son David, who wanted to become a professional soccer player. However, she later found her life becoming relatively dull, so she decided to meet artists, painters, and musicians. One of the first musicians Madonna met in Lisbon was a man named Dino D'Santiago, who she said introduced her to a great many more musicians in the area, including the Batucadeiras, a collective of drummers who she collaborated with on the track \"Batuka\" on this album.\n\nBelieving \"music is the soul of the universe\", she felt connected to her new influences, so she then decided to record an album based on her musical experience in the Portuguese city, which she referred to be \"a melting pot of culture musically, from Angola to Guinea-Bissau to Spain to Brazil to France to Cape Verde\".\n\nDuring the period while the album was being worked on in Portugal, where she lives, Madonna posted short video clips and images chronicling her work on the album. French producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï, who has previously co-produced three of Madonna's albums, Music (2000), American Life (2003) and Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), was confirmed to be one of the key producers for Madame X. Mike Dean, who co-produced Rebel Heart (2015), was also enlisted in the album's production. In February 2019, Maluma uploaded a picture on his Instagram account with Madonna in a studio. In her interview with Vogue Italia, Madonna divulged that her album was due for release in 2019. On April 14, 2019, she posted a series of teaser clips on her Instagram account, revealing Madame X as the album title.\n\nTitle, artwork, and themes\nIn a one-minute teaser uploaded to Madonna's official Instagram and YouTube accounts, Madonna declares herself as \"Madame X\", an alter-ego her album is named after, which is also the title of a 1908 play written by Alexandre Bisson. The video opens with Madonna singing, \"The thing that hurt the most was that I wasn't lost...I wasn't lost...\"\n\nShe then elaborates that Madame X features different personas and characters:\n\nMadame X is a secret agent. Traveling around the world. Changing identities. Fighting for freedom. Bringing light to dark places. She is a dancer. A professor. A head of state. A housekeeper. An equestrian. A prisoner. A student. A mother. A child. A teacher. A nun. A singer. A saint. A whore. A spy in the house of love. I am Madame X.\n\nThe character of Madame X frequently exhibits an eye patch, a trait that Madonna later elaborated on an interview for the Today Show to be a \"cover up\" for a wound.\n\nMadonna claims that she was given the name of the album at the age of 19 by her then dance teacher Martha Graham. According to Madonna, Graham said \"I'm going to give you a new name: Madame X. Every day, you come to school and I don't recognize you. Every day, you change your identity. You're a mystery to me.\"\n\nThe album artwork features a close-up of the Madame X persona, with the title etched across her ruby red lips to give the illusion of her mouth being sewn shut. Mike Wass from Idolator called it an \"already-iconic artwork\" and compared the imagery to that of Frida Kahlo. It is used in most of digital and physical formats of the album, except the digital deluxe and box set, both of which feature another photograph of blonde Madonna.\n\nComposition\nAccording to AllMusic and The Daily Telegraph, the album consists of three main sounds: Latin music, trap music, and art pop.\n\nMadame X is Madonna's most linguistically diverse album, sung in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.\n\nCritical reception\nProfessional ratings\nAggregate scores\nSource\tRating\nMetacritic\t72/100\nReview scores\nSource\tRating\nAllMusic\t4/5 stars\nThe Guardian\t4/5 stars\nmusicOMH\t4.5/5 stars\nNME\t4/5 stars\nQ\t4/5 stars\nRolling Stone\t3/5 stars\nThe Telegraph\t3/5 stars\nThe Times\t4/5 stars\nMadame X received a weighted score of 72 out of 100 from review aggregate website Metacritic, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\", based on 17 reviews by music critics.

The album was released in July 1993 on One Little Indian Records in the United Kingdom and Elektra Records in the United States. Björk worked on the album with producer Nellee Hooper who co-wrote five of Debut's songs with her. The album mostly consists of love songs relating to subjects such as her boyfriend Dominic Thrupp, her producer Nellee Hooper and to love of life itself. Musically, the songs on this album took a different direction from her previous albums with her former band The Sugarcubes, with the backing music ranging from house, jazz and trip hop styles.\n \nMost of the songs from Debut were written years prior to the production of the album. As well as working with Graham Massey, Björk wanted to work with jazz musicians and contacted Oliver Lake and Corky Hale to record jazz arrangements to some of the songs. After meeting producer Nellee Hooper, the two completed production on the album in 1993. On Debut's initial release, the album sold far greater than her label predicted, charting at number three in the United Kingdom and sixty-one in the United States. The album was certified gold in Canada and platinum in the United States. Debut received widespread critical acclaim from British critics who praised Björk's vocals and the choice of a wide range of musical styles on the album. In the United States, the album received more mixed reviews, with some critics complaining about the lack of rock music on Debut.\n \nFive singles were released from Debut: \"Human Behaviour\", \"Venus as a Boy\", \"Play Dead\", \"Big Time Sensuality\" and \"Violently Happy\". \"Play Dead\" was recorded after the album's release and was later issued as a bonus track in a few regions. All five singles charted in the United Kingdom with only \"Human Behaviour\", \"Violently Happy\" and \"Big Time Sensuality\" charting on dance and modern rock charts in the United States.

The full version of the release will include a CD of 11 songs performed live at the Olympic Studios, a DVD of Björk's live performances in Paris and Reykjavík during the Volta tour, a second DVD of the Volta music videos as well as videos of the top ten runners-up from the \"Innocence\" video contest, and a second CD of remixes from Volta's singles. The official worldwide release date of all editions was June 23, 2009. The artwork was nominated for an award at the 2010 Brit Insurance Design Awards.","price":29.99,"discount":0.1,"rating":"4.5"},{"id":"741be1df-9aae-4676-94f1-bcc007888631","artist":"Björk","name":"Biophilia","year":"2011","cover":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/biophilia-4ee353337d4ba.jpg","disc":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/biophilia-4f0261b16bfcd.png","genre":"Alternative Rock","style":"Rock/Pop","description":"Ever the inventive artist, for her eighth studio long-player Björk also turned inventor, commissioning the construction of specialist instruments to compose these 10 tracks upon. Among them, the gameleste – a fusion of gamelan and celeste – which can be heard, a persistent twinkle in the mix, across this set’s lead single, Crystalline. The Icelander also turned to rather more modern hardware for this album – certain tracks are partly recorded on an iPad, and the intention is for each of these tracks to emerge as an app, as well as via traditional album formats.\nImpressively 21st century stuff, for sure. But while her commitment to composition away from typical means – she doesn’t play piano or guitar, so seeking new options is both a necessity and a novelty – is commendable, experimentation is nothing without accessibility, especially for a musician with an audience as sizeable as Björk’s. Thankfully, Biophilia serves as wonderfully as a ‘standard’ album as anything else – a plus, given that interest in her app series is, one imagines, slightly on the wane (it certainly is in this writer’s household). Conceptual in the sense that each song is associated with a readily presented theme – typically of either an earthbound or extraterrestrial nature, from lunar cycles (opener Moon) to tectonic plates beneath our feet (Mutual Core) – it doesn’t overload the listener with powerful ideology. If desired, one can detach from the lyrical message and dive into a most rewardingly singular din – again, Björk has crafted sounds which are entirely hers alone.\nOver the years her voice has mellowed – now, rather than fly off the scale to the occasional detriment of the music around it, it’s a controlled presence, complementing perfectly the whirrs and clicks, static and choral highs which surround it. And the music flits from the sublime to the strikingly brutal – the aforementioned Mutual Core slips from blissful ambience into bombastic electronic percussion, leaving the senses reeling, only to fade back into a comforting lilt; and Crystalline’s jungle-flavoured breakdown come its climax (part-Aphex Twin, part-Reprazent) is one of the best jaw-on-the-floor moments in 2011 pop so far. Closer Solstice is a mellow affair which recalls the sounds of a non-Björk app, namely the relax-into-this puzzler Quell and its Steve Cravis soundtrack. Elsewhere, there are echoes of albums past: Hollow is a dark, menacing relation of the delicate fare that dominated 2001’s Vespertine; Cosmogony commands brass into action, bubbling beneath heavenly choral backing vocals; and Thunderbolt initially stirs unlikely thoughts of The Anchor Song, from 1993’s Debut, before progressing into something multi-layered and magical.\nFocusing on the genesis of Biophilia is an unfortunate inevitability given how much attention has been placed on both its writing process and its newfangled method of distribution. But this is far from a folly, an endeavour designed to flog touch-screen tablets to the singer’s fanbase. It’s a mesmerising album which confirms that Björk can weave dumfounding wonders from Silly String – whatever’s placed before her, she can turn to her advantage, taking her audience on a trip the likes of which no other contemporary artist is capable of planning, let alone embarking on. In a word: amazing. Again.","price":15.99,"discount":0,"rating":"4.1"},{"id":"9cf55c68-7420-48c6-8444-011876e814b1","artist":"Björk","name":"Vulnicura","year":"2015","cover":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/wwutvv1429583936.jpg","disc":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/vulnicura-558008d0545bf.png","genre":"Alternative Rock","style":"Rock/Pop","description":"Vulnicura is the ninth studio album by Icelandic musician and singer Björk, released on 20 January 2015 by One Little Indian Records.

However, it was made available for purchase two months ahead of schedule following an online leak. \n\nOn 14 January 2015, Björk posted on her Facebook page a handwritten note. \n\"I am so grateful you are still interested in my work!! I appreciate every little bit!!! I wanted to tell you the tale of making of this album. I guess I found in my lap one year into writing it a complete heartbreak album. Kinda surprised how thoroughly I had documented this in pretty much accurate emotional chronology...like 3 songs before a break up and three after. So the anthropologist in me sneaked in and I decided to share them as such. First I was worried it would be too self indulgent but then I felt it might make it even more universal and hopefully the songs could be a help, a crutch to others and prove how biological this process is: the wound and the healing of the wound. Psychologically and physically. It has a stubborn clock attached to it.\nThere is a way out. And then a magic thing happened to me: as I lost one thing something else entered. Alejandro contacted me late summer 2013 and was interested in working with me. It was perfect timing. To make beats to the songs would have taken me 3 years (like on Vespertine) but this enchanted arca would visit me repeatedly and only few months later we had a whole album!!! It is one of the most enjoyable collaboration I have had! I then went ahead and wrote string and choir arrangements and recorded them in Iceland. Towards the end of the album I started looking around for a mixing engineer and was introduced by a mutual friend of ours, Robin Carolan to The Haxan Cloak. He mixed the album and also made a beat for one half of \"family\". Together with Chris Elms, the engineer, we kinda formed a band during the mixing process and this is the album we made !!!\"","price":34.99,"discount":0,"rating":"3.4"},{"id":"7ff6790f-9d58-4133-9c69-560b87bf070f","artist":"Björk","name":"Vespertine","year":"2001","cover":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/vespertine-4dd2f820ee010.jpg","disc":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/wtrwrw1434477891.png","genre":"Electronic","style":"","description":"Vespertine is the fifth studio album by the Icelandic recording artist Björk, released on 27 August 2001.
